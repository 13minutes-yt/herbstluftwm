If you want to contribute to herbstluftwm, this file is for you!

==== Contributing ====
Beside writing code you can help herbstluftwm by testing, reporting bugs,
writing/fixing documentation (e.g. by fixing spelling mistakes) or packaging it
for distributions.

==== Coding style ====
The coding style is similar to the Linux-kernel style with some changes:

  - Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
  - Data type names are CamelCase
  - Globals must be prefixed with g_
  - Always typedef struct, e.g.:
    typedef struct {
        int         first_member;
        long long   other_member;
    } MyStruct;

==== Sending patches ====
You can use git to make commits and create patches from them via the command
git format-patch. You can send those patches via mail[1] or via the irc[2].

==== Internal structure ====
The main modules (i.e. source file + header file) communicate like this if a
key is pressed or if a command is called via herbstclient:

                           X11
                            |
                            V
                        +--------+  key  +-----+ call  +---------+
                        |  main  |------>| key |------>| command |
                        +--------+ event +-----+       +---------+
                            \                    output /  ^
                     IPC-Call\      +------------+<----'  / Execute
                      -Window `---->| ipc-server |-------'  IPC-Call
                        -Event      +------------+
                                           |
                                           V
                                          X11
herbstclient is rather simple:

 Command-Line-   +------+
   Arguments --->| main |----.
                 |      |   X11
    stdout  <----|      |<---'
                 +------+

// vim: nowrap
