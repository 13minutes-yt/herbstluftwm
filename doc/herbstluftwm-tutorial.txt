herbstluftwm-tutorial - A tutorial introduction to herbstluftwm


Description
-----------
This tutorial includes how to create a basic herbstluftwm setup and introduces
the major herbstluftwm features. This tutorial neither covers all features nor
specifies the mentioned features entirely; see *herbstluftwm*(1) for a compact
and more complete description.

Basic installation
------------------
This describes two alternate installation methods. In any case, you also have to
install the dependencies. Beside the standard libraries (GLib, XLib) which are
found on nearly any system, you should install dzen2 (as current as possible)
which is needed by the default +panel.sh+.

Via the package manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You always should prefer installing herbstluftwm via your package manager on your
system. It should be called +herbstluftwm+.

After installing it, the default configuration file has to be copied to your
home directory:

----
mkdir -p ~/.config/herbstluftwm
cp /etc/xdg/herbstluftwm/autostart ~/.confg/herbstluftwm/
----

You also should activate the tab completion for +herbstclient+. In case of
bash, you can either activate the tab completion in general or source the
herbstclient-completion from the bash_completion.d directory in your bashrc. In
case of zsh the tab-completion normally is activated already (if not, consider
activating it).

As usual you can define herbstluftwm as your window manager by either selecting
herbstluftwm in your login manager or by starting it in your +~/.xinitrc+,
mostly by writing to your xinitrc (or +.xsession+ on some systems):

----
# start herbstluftwm in locked mode (it will be unlocked at the end of your
# autostart)
exec herbstluftwm --locked
----

After logging in the next time, you will get a default herbstluftwm session.

Directly from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is no package for your plattform or if you want to use the current git
version, then you can pull directly from the main repository:

----
git clone git://git.cs.fau.de/hlwm herbstluftwm
cd herbstluftwm
# if you want to use the stable version of herbstluftwm, then type:
# git checkout stable
# you can switch back to the development version anytime by:
# git checkout master
make # build the binaries

# install files
mkdir -p ~/bin
# you also have to put $HOME/bin to your path, e.g. by:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc # or to your zshrc, etc...
ln -s `pwd`/herbstluftwm ~/bin/
ln -s `pwd`/herbstclient ~/bin/

# copy the configuration
mkdir -p ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
cp share/autostart ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
cp share/panel.sh ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
----

  - If you are using bash, then source the bash completion file in your +~/.bashrc+
+
----
source path-to/herbstluftwm/share/herbstclient-completion
----

  - If you are using zsh, then copy the +share/_herbstclient+ file to the
    appropriate zsh-completion directory.

Each time, there is an update, you have to do the following steps in your
herbstluftwm directory:

----
git pull
make
----

You also can switch to another branch (e.g. +stable+ for the current release
or +master+ for the development version), by doing this in your herbstluftwm
directory:

----
git checkout desiredbranch # insert the branch here
make cleandeps
make
----

First steps
-----------
After starting herbstluftwm the screen is filled with a green background
initially, which indicates, that there is only one large frame. A frame is a
container where actual windows can be placed or which can be split into two
frames.

Start an +xterm+ by pressing Alt-Return, which will fill your entire screen.

Client
~~~~~~
The only way to communicate to herbstluftwm is by using the client application
called +herbstclient+. Its usual syntax is: +herbstclient COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]+.
This calls a certain +COMMAND+ within your running herbstluftwm instance, causes
some effect (which depends on the given +ARGUMENTS+). This produces some output
which is printed by +herbstclient+ and lets +herbstclient+ exit with a exit-code
(e.g. 0 for success) like many other UNIX tools:

----
    shell              COMMANDS,
       \ COMMAND,      ARGUMENTS
        \ ARGUMENTS  .---------.
         \          /           \
          V        /             V
         herbstclient         herbstluftwm
          /        ^             /
         / output,  \           /
        / exit-code  '---------'
       V               output,
 shell/terminal       exit-code
----

The most simple command only prints the herbstluftwm version:

$ # lines prefixed with $ describes what to type, other lines describe the
$ # typical output
$ # Type: her<tab>c<tab> ve<tab>
$ herbstclient version
herbstluftwm 0.4.1 (built on Aug 30 2012)
$ herbstclient set window_border_active_color red
$ # now the window border turned red

The configuration of herbstluftwm only is done by calling commands via
herbstclient. So the only configuration file is the +autostart+ which is placed
at +~/.config/herbstluftwm/+ and which is a sequence of those herbstclient
calls.

Open it in your favourite text editor and replace the Mod-line by this to use
the Super-key (or also called Windows-key) as the main modifier:

----
# Mod=Mod1 # use alt as the main modifier
Mod=Mod4 # use Super as the main modifier
----

After saving the autostart file, you have to reload the configuration:

----
# the following line is identical to directly calling:
# ~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart
herbstclient reload
----

Now you may notice that the red border color of your terminal turned green
again, because the color is set in the default autostart. That's the typical
configuration workflow:

  . Try some new settings in the command line
  . Add them to the autostart file
  . Press Mod-Shift-r which calls the +reload+ command or directly execute the
    autostart file from your shell to get the error messages if something went
    wrong.
