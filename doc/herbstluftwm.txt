NAME
----
herbstluftwm - a manual tiling window manager for X


SYNOPSIS
--------
*herbstluftwm*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Starts the *herbstluftwm* window manager on 'DISPLAY'. It also listens for
calls from *herbstclient*(1) and executes them. The list of available
<<COMMANDS,*COMMANDS*>> is listed below.

TILING ALGORITHM
----------------
The basic tiling concept is, that the layout is represented by a binary tree. On
startup you see one big frame across the entire screen. A frame fullfilles
exactly one of the following conditions:

    . Frame contains windows: +
        He shows some clients and arranges them next to each other. There are
        the current layouut algorithms:

        * Vertical ('frame_layout' = 0)
        * Horizontal ('frame_layout' = 1)

    . Frame is split into subframes: +
        He is split into exactly two *subframes* in a configurable 'fraction'
        either in a vertical or horizontal way. So he produces two *frames*
        which fullfille the same conditions (new frames always are about to
        contain *windows*).

If a new window appears, it is put in the currently focused frame. Only
frames that have the type "contains *windows*" can be focused.

A frame can be removed, so it is merged with its neighbour frame. Due to the
layout structure of a binary tree, each frame (i.e. node in binary tree) has
exactly one neighbour.

The analogy to a binary Tree is explained the best way with a small example:
On startup you have an simple binary tree, with one frame that can contain
clients:

    C

When splitting it (e.g. with command 'split vertical 0.5') you will get this:

    V
   / \
  C   C

You also can split the left frame horizontally and you will get:

     V
    / \
   H   C
  / \
 C   C

If you change the focus to the client on the right and remove this frame, it
will be merged wit the left subtree and you will get:

   H
  / \
 C   C

The 'layout' command prints the current layout of all tags as a tree.

TAGS
----
Tags are very similar to workspaces or virtual desktops or window groups. Each
tag has one layout. There is a list of tags. You can add or remove tags
dynamically.

There is also a list of monitors. Each monitor displays exactly one tag.
