NAME
----
herbstluftwm - a manual tiling window manager for X


SYNOPSIS
--------
*herbstluftwm*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Starts the *herbstluftwm* window manager on 'DISPLAY'. It also listens for
calls from *herbstclient*(1) and executes them. The list of available
<<COMMANDS,*COMMANDS*>> is listed below.

TILING ALGORITHM
----------------
The basic tiling concept is, that the layout is represented by a binary tree. On
startup you see one big frame across the entire screen. A frame fullfilles
exactly one of the following conditions:

    . Frame contains windows: +
        He shows some clients and arranges them next to each other. There are
        the current layouut algorithms:

        * Vertical ('frame_layout' = 0)
        * Horizontal ('frame_layout' = 1)

    . Frame is split into subframes: +
        He is split into exactly two *subframes* in a configurable 'fraction'
        either in a vertical or horizontal way. So he produces two *frames*
        which fullfille the same conditions (new frames always are about to
        contain *windows*).

If a new window appears, it is put in the currently focused frame. Only
frames that have the type "contains *windows*" can be focused.

A frame can be removed, so it is merged with its neighbour frame. Due to the
layout structure of a binary tree, each frame (i.e. node in binary tree) has
exactly one neighbour.

The analogy to a binary Tree is explained the best way with a small example:
On startup you have an simple binary tree, with one frame that can contain
clients:

    C

When splitting it (e.g. with command 'split vertical 0.5') you will get this:

    V
   / \
  C   C

You also can split the left frame horizontally and you will get:

     V
    / \
   H   C
  / \
 C   C

If you change the focus to the client on the right and remove this frame, it
will be merged wit the left subtree and you will get:

   H
  / \
 C   C

The 'layout' command prints the current layout of all tags as a tree.

TAGS
----
Tags are very similar to workspaces or virtual desktops or window groups. Each
tag has one layout. There is a list of tags. You can add or remove tags
dynamically.

There is also a list of monitors. Each monitor displays exactly one tag on a
specified rectangle on the screen.

[[COMMANDS]]
COMMANDS
--------
// TODO examples in fixed font in html output
*herbstluftwm* is controlled by internal commands, which can be executed via
*herbstclient*(1) or via keybindings.

quit::
    quits herbstluftwm

reload::
    realoads configfile.

version::
    prints the version of running herbstluftwm instance.

list_commands::
    lists all available commands.

[[list_monitors]]list_monitors::
    list currently setuped monitors with their index, area (as rectangle) and currently
    viewed tag.

keybind 'KEY' 'COMMAND' ['ARGS ...']::
    adds a key binding. When 'KEY' is pressed, the internal 'COMMAND' (with its
    'ARGS') is executed. A Keybinding is a (possibly empty) list of modifiers
    (Mod4, Mod1, Alt, Super, Ctrl, Shift) and one key (see keysymdef.h for a
    list of keys). Modifiers and the key are concated with '-' or '+' as
    separator. If there is already a binding for this 'KEY', it will be
    overwritten. Examples:

        * keybind Mod4+Ctrl+q quit
        * keybind Mod1-i toggle always_show_frame
        * keybind Mod1-Shift-space cycle_layout -1

keyunbind 'KEY'::
    removes the key binding for 'KEY'. Syntax for 'KEY' is defined in *keybind*.

spawn 'EXECUTABLE' ['ARGS ...']::
    spawns an 'EXECUTABLE' with its 'ARGS'. For details see 'man 3 execvp'.
    Example:

        * spawn xterm -e man 3 execvp

cycle ['DELTA']::
    cycles the selection within the current frame by 'DELTA'. If no 'DELTA' is
    omitted, 'DELTA' = 1 will be used. 'DELTA' can be negative; 'DELTA' = -1
    means: cycle in the opposite direction by 1.

cycle_layout ['DELTA']::
    cycles the layout algorithm in the current frame by 'DELTA'. 'DELTA'
    defaults to 1. Currently only 1 is usefull because there are only two
    algorithms yet:

        * vertical (below each other)
        * horizontal (next to each other)
close::
    closes the focused window.

split 'ALIGN' 'FACTION'::
    splits the focused frame into two subframes with a specified 'FRACTION'
    between 0 and 1. 'ALIGN' can be 'horizontal' or 'vertical' (actually it only
    depends on, if the first letter of 'ALIGN'). Example:

        * split horiz 0.3
        * split vertical 0.5
        * split h 0.8
focus 'DIRECTION'::
    moves the focus from current frame to the next frame in 'DIRECTION' which is
    in:

        * l[eft]
        * r[eft]
        * u[eft]
        * d[eft]
    Direction is defined as follows: Focus is in a leave of the binary tree.
    Each inner node in the tree remembers the last focus direction (child 0 or
    child 1). The algorithm is going as short as possible from the leave (the
    currently focused frame) to the root until it is possible to change focus in
    the specified 'DIRECTION'. From there the focus goes back to the leave. +
    +
    Example: The focus is at frame A. After executing 'focus right' focus will
    be at frame C.

 Tree:  V,0     Screen: .-----..-----. (before)
        / \             |  B  ||  C  |
       /   \            '-----''-----'
     H,1   H,0          .-----..-----.
     / \   / \          |  A* ||  D  |
    A*  B C   D         '-----''-----'

 Tree:  V,0     Screen: .-----..-----. (after focus right)
        / \             |  B  ||  C* |
       /   \            '-----''-----'
     H,1   H,0          .-----..-----.
     / \   / \          |  A  ||  D  |
    A   B C*  D         '-----''-----'

shift 'DIRECTION'::
    shifts the focused window to the next frame in the specified 'DIRECTION'.
    The 'DIRECTIONS' behave as specified at the 'focus' command. If
    'focus_follows_shift' is set, then focus stays in the window; otherwise it
    stays in the frame.

remove::
    removes focused frame and merges its windows to its neighbour frame.

set 'NAME' 'VALUE'::
    sets the specified setting 'NAME' to 'VALUE'. All <<SETTINGS,*SETTINGS*>>
    are listed in the <<SETTINGS, section below>>.

get 'NAME'::
    prints the value of setting 'NAME'. All <<SETTINGS,*SETTINGS*>>
    are listed in the <<SETTINGS, section below>>.

toggle 'NAME'::
    toggles the setting 'NAME' if its an integer setting: if value was 0, it
    becomes 1, else value becomes 0.

cycle_monitor ['DELTA']::
    cycles monitor focused by 'DELTA'. 'DELTA' defaults to 1.

add 'TAG'::
    creates a new empty tag named 'TAG'.

use 'TAG'::
    switches focused monitor to specified 'TAG'.

merge_tag 'TAG' ['TARGET']::
    removes tag named 'TAG' and moves all its windows to tag 'TARGET'. If no
    'TARGET' is omitted, the focused tag will be used.

rename 'OLDTAG' 'NEWTAG'::
    renames tag named 'OLDTAG' to 'NEWTAG'.

move 'TAG'::
    moves the focused window to tag named 'TAG'.

add_monitor 'RECT' 'TAG'::
    adds a monitor on the specified rectangle 'RECT' and displays 'TAG' on it.
    'TAG' currently must not be displayed on any other monitor. 'RECT' is a
    string of the form 'WxH+X+Y'. Example:

        * add_monitor 1024x768-20+0 mynewtag


remove_monitor 'INDEX'::
    removes the monitor with specified 'INDEX'. Its 'INDEX' can be found out via
    the <<list_monitors,'list_monitors'>> command.

move_monitor 'INDEX' 'RECT'::
    moves the monitor wit hspecified 'INDEX' to rectangle 'RECT'. 'INDEX' and
    'RECT' is defined as in 'remove_monitor' and 'add_monitor'.

layout::
    prints the layout of all tags with focus indicators.

complete 'POSITION' ['COMMAND' 'ARGS ...']::
    prints the result of tab completion in partial writting 'COMMAND' with
    optional 'ARGS'. You usually do not need this, because there is already tab
    completion for bash. Example:

        * complete 0 m +
          prints all commands beginning with m
        * complete 1 toggle fra +
          prints all settings that can be toggled
