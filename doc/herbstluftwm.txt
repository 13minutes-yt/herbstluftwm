NAME
----
herbstluftwm - a manual tiling window manager for X


SYNOPSIS
--------
*herbstluftwm* ['OPTION' ...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Starts the *herbstluftwm* window manager on 'DISPLAY'. It also listens for
calls from *herbstclient*(1) and executes them. The list of available
<<COMMANDS,*COMMANDS*>> is listed below.

'OPTION' can be:

    *-c*, *--autostart* 'PATH'::
        use 'PATH' as autostart file instead of the one in '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME'
    *-v*, *--version*::
        print version and exit
    *--verbose*::
        print verbose information to stderr

TILING ALGORITHM
----------------
The basic tiling concept is, that the layout is represented by a binary tree. On
startup you see one big frame across the entire screen. A frame fulfills
exactly one of the following conditions:

    . Frame contains windows: +
        It shows some clients and arranges them next to each other. The
        current layout algorithms are:

        * Vertical ('frame_layout' = 0)
        * Horizontal ('frame_layout' = 1)

    . Frame is split into subframes: +
        It is split into exactly two *subframes* in a configurable 'fraction'
        either in a vertical or horizontal way. So it produces two *frames*
        which fulfill the same conditions (new frames always are about to
        contain *windows*).

If a new window appears, it is put in the currently focused frame. Only
frames that have the type "contains *windows*" can be focused.

A frame can be removed, so it is merged with its neighbour frame. Due to the
layout structure of a binary tree, each frame (i.e. node in binary tree) has
exactly one neighbour.

The analogy to a binary Tree is explained the best way with a small example:
On startup you have a simple binary tree, with one frame that can contain
clients:

    C

When splitting it (e.g. with command 'split vertical 0.5') you will get this:

    V
   / \
  C   C

You also can split the left frame horizontally and you will get:

     V
    / \
   H   C
  / \
 C   C

If you change the focus to the client on the right and remove this frame, it
will be merged with the left subtree and you will get:

   H
  / \
 C   C

The 'layout' command prints the current layout of all tags as a tree.

TAGS
----
Tags are very similar to workspaces, virtual desktops or window groups. Each
tag has one layout. There is a list of tags. You can add or remove tags
dynamically.

There is also a list of monitors. Each monitor displays exactly one tag on a
specified rectangle on the screen.

[[COMMANDS]]
COMMANDS
--------
// TODO examples in fixed font in html output
*herbstluftwm* is controlled by internal commands, which can be executed via
*herbstclient*(1) or via keybindings.

quit::
    quits herbstluftwm

reload::
    executes the autostart file

version::
    prints the version of the running herbstluftwm instance.

list_commands::
    lists all available commands.

[[list_monitors]]list_monitors::
    list currently configured monitors with their index, area (as rectangle) and currently
    viewed tag.

keybind 'KEY' 'COMMAND' ['ARGS ...']::
    adds a key binding. When 'KEY' is pressed, the internal 'COMMAND' (with its
    'ARGS') is executed. A Keybinding is a (possibly empty) list of modifiers
    (Mod4, Mod1, Alt, Super, Ctrl, Shift) and one key (see keysymdef.h for a
    list of keys). Modifiers and the key are concatenated with '-' or '+' as
    separator. If there is already a binding for this 'KEY', it will be
    overwritten. Examples:

        * keybind Mod4+Ctrl+q quit
        * keybind Mod1-i toggle always_show_frame
        * keybind Mod1-Shift-space cycle_layout -1

keyunbind 'KEY'::
    removes the key binding for 'KEY'. Syntax for 'KEY' is defined in *keybind*.

spawn 'EXECUTABLE' ['ARGS ...']::
    spawns an 'EXECUTABLE' with its 'ARGS'. For details see 'man 3 execvp'.
    Example:

        * spawn xterm -e man 3 execvp

wmexec 'WINDOWMANAGER' ['ARGS ...']::
    executes the 'WINDOWMANAGER' with its 'ARGS'. This is useful to switch the
    window manager in the running session without restarting the session. For
    details see 'man 3 execvp'. Example:

        * wmexec openbox

cycle ['DELTA']::
    cycles the selection within the current frame by 'DELTA'. If 'DELTA' is
    omitted, 'DELTA' = 1 will be used. 'DELTA' can be negative; 'DELTA' = -1
    means: cycle in the opposite direction by 1.

cycle_all ['DIRECTION']::
    cycles through all windows and frames on the current tag. 'DIRECTION' = 1
    means forward, 'DIRECTION' = -1 means backward, 'DIRECTION' = 0 has no
    effect. 'DIRECTION' defaults to 1. If there are multiple windows within on
    frame, then it acts similar to the 'cycle' command. (The 'cycle_all' command
    focuses the next/previous leave in the 'layout' tree)

cycle_layout ['DELTA']::
    cycles the layout algorithm in the current frame by 'DELTA'. 'DELTA'
    defaults to 1. Currently only 1 is useful because there are only two
    algorithms so far:

        * vertical (below each other)
        * horizontal (next to each other)
close::
    closes the focused window.

split 'ALIGN' 'FACTION'::
    splits the focused frame into two subframes with a specified 'FRACTION'
    between 0 and 1. 'ALIGN' can be 'horizontal' or 'vertical' (actually it only
    depends on the first letter of 'ALIGN'). Example:

        * split horiz 0.3
        * split vertical 0.5
        * split h 0.8

focus 'DIRECTION'::
    moves the focus from current frame to the next frame in 'DIRECTION' which is
    in:

        * l[eft]
        * r[ight]
        * u[p]
        * d[own]
    Direction is defined as follows: Focus is in a leaf of the binary tree.
    Each inner node in the tree remembers the last focus direction (child 0 or
    child 1). The algorithm is going as short as possible from the leaf (the
    currently focused frame) to the root until it is possible to change focus in
    the specified 'DIRECTION'. From there the focus goes back to the leaf. +
    +
    Example: The focus is at frame A. After executing 'focus right' focus will
    be at frame C.

 Tree:  V,0     Screen: .-----..-----. (before)
        / \             |  B  ||  C  |
       /   \            '-----''-----'
     H,1   H,0          .-----..-----.
     / \   / \          |  A* ||  D  |
    A*  B C   D         '-----''-----'

 Tree:  V,0     Screen: .-----..-----. (after focus right)
        / \             |  B  ||  C* |
       /   \            '-----''-----'
     H,1   H,0          .-----..-----.
     / \   / \          |  A  ||  D  |
    A   B C*  D         '-----''-----'

resize 'DIRECTION' 'FRACTIONDELTA'::
    changes the next fraction in specified 'DIRECTION' by 'FRACTIONDELTA'.
    'DIRECTION' is specified at the 'focus' command. You should not omit the
    sign '-' or '+', because in future versions, the behaviour may change if the
    sign is omitted. Example:

        * resize right +0.05
        * resize down -0.1

shift 'DIRECTION'::
    shifts the focused window to the next frame in the specified 'DIRECTION'.
    The 'DIRECTIONS' behave as specified at the 'focus' command. If
    'focus_follows_shift' is set, then focus stays in the window; otherwise it
    stays in the frame.

remove::
    removes focused frame and merges its windows to its neighbour frame.

set 'NAME' 'VALUE'::
    sets the specified setting 'NAME' to 'VALUE'. All <<SETTINGS,*SETTINGS*>>
    are listed in the <<SETTINGS, section below>>.

get 'NAME'::
    prints the value of setting 'NAME'. All <<SETTINGS,*SETTINGS*>>
    are listed in the <<SETTINGS, section below>>.

toggle 'NAME'::
    toggles the setting 'NAME' if it's an integer setting: if value was 0, it
    becomes 1, else value becomes 0.

cycle_monitor ['DELTA']::
    cycles monitor focused by 'DELTA'. 'DELTA' defaults to 1.

focus_monitor 'INDEX'::
    puts focus to monitor with specified 'INDEX' (as specified by the
    list_monitors command)

add 'TAG'::
    creates a new empty tag named 'TAG'.

use 'TAG'::
    switches focused monitor to specified 'TAG'.

merge_tag 'TAG' ['TARGET']::
    removes tag named 'TAG' and moves all its windows to tag 'TARGET'. If
    'TARGET' is omitted, the focused tag will be used.

rename 'OLDTAG' 'NEWTAG'::
    renames tag named 'OLDTAG' to 'NEWTAG'.

move 'TAG'::
    moves the focused window to tag named 'TAG'.

add_monitor 'RECT' 'TAG' ['PADUP' ['PADRIGHT' ['PADDOWN' ['PADLEFT']]]]::
    adds a monitor on the specified rectangle 'RECT' and displays 'TAG' on it.
    'TAG' currently must not be displayed on any other monitor. 'RECT' is a
    string of the form 'WxH+X+Y'. The padding specifies extra space around the
    monitor for some statusbars/panels. If no padding is given, it is set to 0.
    Example:

        * add_monitor 1024x768-20+0 mynewtag 16


remove_monitor 'INDEX'::
    removes the monitor with specified 'INDEX'. Its 'INDEX' can be found out via
    the <<list_monitors,'list_monitors'>> command.

move_monitor 'INDEX' 'RECT' ['PADUP' ['PADRIGHT' ['PADDOWN' ['PADLEFT']]]]::
    moves the monitor with specified 'INDEX' to rectangle 'RECT'. 'INDEX' and
    'RECT' are defined as in 'remove_monitor' and 'add_monitor'. If no padding is
    given, it is not changed.

pad 'INDEX' ['PADUP' ['PADRIGHT' ['PADDOWN' ['PADLEFT']]]]::
    sets the pad of indexed monitor to the specified padding. If no padding is
    given, it is not changed.

layout ['TAG']::
    prints the layout of 'TAG' in a nice tree style. Its style is defined
    by the 'tree_style' setting. If no 'TAG' is given, current tag is used.
    +
An example output is:
+
----
╾─┐horizontal 50% selection=1
  ├╼ vertical: 0xe00009
  └─┐vertical 50% selection=0
    ├╼ vertical: 0xa00009 [FOCUS]
    └╼ vertical: 0x1000009
----

dump ['TAG']::
    prints the same information as the 'layout' command but in a machine
    readable format. Its output can be read back with the 'load' command.
    +
An example output (formatted afterwards) is:
+
----
(split horizontal:0.500000:1
    (clients vertical:0 0xe00009)
    (splitvertical:0.500000:1
        (clients vertical:0 0xa00009)
        (clients vertical:0 0x1000009)))
----

load ['TAG'] 'LAYOUT'::
    loads a given 'LAYOUT' description to specified 'TAG' or current tag if no
    'TAG' is given.

CAUTION: 'LAYOUT' is exactly one parameter. If you are calling it manually
from your shell or from a script, quote it properly!

complete 'POSITION' ['COMMAND' 'ARGS ...']::
    prints the result of tab completion in partial written 'COMMAND' with
    optional 'ARGS'. You usually do not need this, because there is already tab
    completion for bash. Example:

        * complete 0 m +
          prints all commands beginning with m
        * complete 1 toggle fra +
          prints all settings beginning with fra that can be toggled

emit_hook 'ARGS ...'::
    emits specified hook to all idling herbstclients.

floating [on|off|toggle]::
    changes the current tag to floating/tiling mode. If no argument is given,
    floating mode is toggled.


[[SETTINGS]]
SETTINGS
--------
Settings configure the behaviour of herbstluftwm and can be controlled via the
'set', 'get' and 'toggle' command. There are two types of settings: Strings and
integer values. An integer value is set, if its value is 1 or another value
unequal to 0. An integer value is unset, if its value is 0.

window_gap (Integer)::
    the gap between frames in the tiling mode.

snap_distance (Integer)::
    if a client is dragged in floating mode, then it snaps to neighbour clients
    if the distance between them is smaller then snap_distance.

snap_gap (Integer)::
    specifies the remainig gap if a dragged client snaps to an edge in floating
    mode. If snap_gap is set to 0, no gap will remain.

frame_border_active_color (String/Color)::
    the border color of a focused frame

frame_border_normal_color (String/Color)::
    the border color of an unfocused frame

frame_bg_active_color (String/Color)::
    the fill color of a focused frame

frame_bg_normal_color (String/Color)::
    the fill color of an unfocused frame (It is only visible if
    always_show_frame is set)

frame_bg_transparent (Integer)::
    if set, frames have transparent backgrounds.

frame_border_width (Integer)::
    border width of a frame

raise_on_focus (Integer)::
    if set, a window is raised if it is focused. The value of this setting is
    only noticed in floating mode.

window_border_width (Integer)::
    border width of a window

window_border_active_color (String/Color)::
    border color of a focused window

window_border_normal_color (String/Color)::
    border color of an unfocused window

always_show_frame (Integer)::
    If set, all frames are displayed. If unset, only frames with focus or with
    windows in it are displayed.

default_frame_layout (Integer)::
    sets the frame layout, if a new frame is created (by split or on a new tag).

        * 0 means vertical
        * 1 means horizontal

focus_follows_shift (Integer)::
    If set, focus stays in the window, if window is shifted to another frame.
    If unset, focus stays in the frame.

focus_follows_mouse (Integer)::
    If set and a window is focused by mouse cursor, this window is focused (This
    feature is also known as sloppy focus). If unset, you need to click to
    change the window focus by mouse.

swap_monitors_to_get_tag (Integer)::
    If set: If you want to view a tag, that already is viewed on another
    monitor, then the monitor contents will be swapped and you see the wanted
    tag on the focused monitor. If not set, nothing will be swapped.

ignore_class (String/Regex)::
    If the class property of a new created window matches the ignore_class
    regex, then it will not be managed, i.e. will not be put in the layout or on
    tags. Example value: +^(Xfce4-notifyd|Conky)$+

tree_style (String)::
    It contains the chars that are used to print a nice ascii tree. It must
    contain at least 8 characters. e.g. ++X|:#+*-.++ produces a tree like:
+
----
X-.root
  #-.child 0
  | #* child 01
  | +* child 02
  +-.child 1
  : #* child 10
  : +* child 01
----
+
Usefull values for 'tree_style' are: +╾│ ├└╼─┐+ or +╾│ ├╰╼─╮+.

AUTOSTART FILE
--------------

There is no config file but an autostart file, which is executed on startup. It
is also executed on command 'reload'. If not specified by the *--autostart*
argument, autostart file is located at '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herbstluftwm/autostart'
or at '~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart'. Normally it consists of a few
*herbstclient* calls.

For a quick install, copy the default autostart file to
'~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart' and make it executable.


ENVIRONTMENT VARIABLES
----------------------
DISPLAY::
    specifies the 'DISPLAY' to use.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Always returns *0*.

BUGS
----
