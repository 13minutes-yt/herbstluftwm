==== First steps ====
# 1. compile it
make
# 2. copy ipc-client/herbstclient to a bin-folder or adjust path in herbstluftrc
# 3. copy default config file to your config-dir (typically ~/.config/)
mkdir -p "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME" && cp share/herbstluftrc "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/
# 4. add the share/herbstclient-completion to your /etc/bash_completion.d/ folder
#    or source it in your bashrc
# 5. run it in a session that has no windowmanager yet

==== Internal structure ====
The internal structure of herbstluftwm is as follows:

all boxes are C-Modules (e.g. $name.c-files)
