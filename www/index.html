    herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X11 using Xlib and Glib.
    Its main features can be described with:

    <ul>

     <li>the layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split
     again or can be filled with windows (similar to <a
     href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a>/<a
     href="http://aerosuidae.net/musca.html">musca</a>)</li>

     <li> tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or ...) can be added/removed
     at runtime. Each tag contains an own layout</li>

     <li> exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor
     independent (similar to <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>)</li>

     <li> it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
     configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar to <a
     href="http://wmii.suckless.org/">wmii</a>/<a
     href="http://aerosuidae.net/musca.html">musca</a>)</li>

    </ul>

   <h1 id="getit">Get It</h1>
   There aren't any releases yet. You can browse the source in the 
   <a
   href="http://git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/?p=re06huxa/herbstluftwm">GitWeb</a>
   or directly clone the git repository with:

    <div class="codeblock">
        git clone git://git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/re06huxa/herbstluftwm
    </div>


   <h1 id="faq">Hints and FAQ</h1>

   <h2>Hint: Use the forc^H^H^H^Hscripts</h2>
   There are a bunch of scripts coming along with herbstluftwm. Check out the
   scripts directory in the sources and the examples directory after installing.

   <h2>Hint: Don't restart</h2>
   To make configchanges take effect immediately, just type <span
   class="code">herbstclient reload</span>. No need to restart hlwm/X.

   <h2>Why is herbstluftwm called herbstluftwm?</h2>
   I liked the name of the e-mail client wanderlust. Unfortunately I am a happy
   mutt user, so I needed an other application with a similar name.

   <h2>If the config is a bashscript, does it mean it is called on each
   keystroke?</h2>
   No, the configfile is executed once to set internal settings and keybindings
   and so on. If a keybind is registred and its key is pressed, the according
   (internal) command directly is called.

   <h2>Why don't new clients get the focus?</h2>
   Because of the default behaviour of the <span class="code">focus</span>
   consequence in the rules. You can change it by adding this to the <a
   href="herbstluftwm.html#RULES">rules</a> section in the autostart file:

   <pre class="codeblock">
hc unrule --all      # clear rules
hc rule focus=on     # focus new clients by default </pre>

    Warning: you need the current git version to get rules!

    <h2>herbstclient is too long to type it in the shell</h2>
    Use tab-completion! <span class="code">her&lt;tab&gt;c&lt;tab&gt;</span>
    expands to herbstclient. There is also a tab-completion for the parameters
    for herbstclient. After installing herbstluftwm, add this to your .bashrc:

   <pre class="codeblock">
source /etc/bash_completion.d/herbstclient-completion</pre>
    (The tab-completion in zsh works out of the box with most
    zsh-configurations).
<br/>
<br/>
    You also can add an alias for herbstclient:
   <pre class="codeblock">
alias hc='herbstclient'
</pre>

    <h2>My rules seem to be messed up</h2>
    Clear them with <span class="code">hc unrule -F</span> and start over. It is
    recommended to do this in the autostartfile.

    <h2>I don't like that my mplayervideo/inputdialogs get resized to full
    framesize</h2>

    Add this to your autostartfile:
    <pre class="codeblock">
hc rule instance=<i>&lt;instancename&gt;</i> pseudotile=on</pre>

    You can request the instancename with xprop by clicking on the related window.
    <span class="code"><i>&lt;instancename&gt;</i></span> is the first string in the
    line <span class="code">WM_CLASS(STRING)</span> (for mplayer that would be <span
    class="code">xv</span>, for firefox dialogs it is <span
    class="code">Dialog</span>).

    <h2>I set default_frame_layout to my favorite layout but it doesn't work
    with the root frame/existing frames</h2>

    Existing tags are not affected by a change of that variable (only new ones),
    so be sure to set it <b>before</b> creating any tags. A current workaround
    is, putting <span class="code">hc split vertical 0.5; hc remove</span> at
    the end in your autostartfile.  You can also 'cycle_layout' in existing
    tags.
