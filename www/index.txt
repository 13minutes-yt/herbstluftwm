What is it?
-----------

herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X11 using Xlib and Glib.
Its main features can be described with:

  * the layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split
    again or can be filled with windows (similar to
    link:http://i3wm.org/[i3]/
    link:http://aerosuidae.net/musca.html[musca])

  * tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or ...) can be added/removed at
    runtime. Each tag contains an own layout

  * exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor independent
    (similar to link:http://xmonad.org/[xmonad])

  * it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
    configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar to
    link:http://wmii.suckless.org/[wmii]/
    link:http://aerosuidae.net/musca.html[musca])

Hints and FAQ
-------------

Hint: Use the forc\^H\^H\^H^Hscripts!::
   There are a bunch of scripts coming along with herbstluftwm. Check out the
   scripts directory in the sources and the examples directory after installing.

Hint: Don't restart::
   To make configchanges take effect immediately, just type +herbstclient
   reload+. There is no need to restart herbstluftwm or X.

Q: Why is herbstluftwm called herbstluftwm?::
   I liked the name of the e-mail client wanderlust. Unfortunately I am a happy
   mutt user, so I needed an other application with a similar name.

Q: If the config is a bashscript, does it mean it is called on each keystroke?::
   No, the configfile is executed once to set internal settings and keybindings
   and so on. If a keybind is registred and its key is pressed, the according
   (internal) command directly is called.

Q: Why don't new clients get the focus?::
   Because of the default behaviour of the +focus+ consequence in the rules.
   You can change it by adding this to the link:herbstluftwm.html#RULES[rules]
   section in the autostart file:
+
----
hc unrule --all      # clear rules
hc rule focus=on     # focus new clients by default
----
+
Warning: you need the current git version to get rules!

Q: herbstclient is too long to type it in the shell::
    Use tab-completion! +her&lt;tab&gt;c&lt;tab&gt;+ expands to herbstclient.
    There is also a tab-completion for the parameters for herbstclient. After
    installing herbstluftwm, add this to your .bashrc:
+
----
source /etc/bash_completion.d/herbstclient-completion
----
+
(The tab-completion in zsh works out of the box with most zsh-configurations).
+
You also can add an alias for herbstclient:
+
----
alias hc='herbstclient'
----

Q: My rules seem to be messed up::
    Clear them with +hc unrule -F+ and start over. It is recommended to do this
    in the autostartfile.

Q: I don't like that my mplayervideo/inputdialogs get resized to full framesize::

Add this to your autostartfile:
+
----
hc rule instance=<instance> pseudotile=on
----
+
You can request the instancename with xprop by clicking on the related window.
+<instancename>+ is the first string in the line +WM_CLASS(STRING)+ (for
mplayer that would be +xv+, for firefox dialogs it is +Dialog+).

Q: I set default_frame_layout to my favorite layout but it doesn't work with the root frame/existing frames::
    Existing tags are not affected by a change of that variable (only new
    ones), so be sure to set it <b>before</b> creating any tags. A current
    workaround is, putting +hc split vertical 0.5; hc remove+ at the end in
    your autostartfile.  You can also 'cycle_layout' in existing tags.

Documentation
-------------
There are manpages in the +doc/+ directory. The also can be seen online:
