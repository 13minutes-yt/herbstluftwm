Some BUGS/TODOS:
    - keyboardfocus stays in window, if cursor is over it and herbstluftwm-focus goes away
    - set range for some integer-setting-values
    - fix 1px-border at bottom of frames if gcd(windows, frameheight) != 1
    - don't allways re-layout all if only one thing changes (e.g. border_color)
    - don't reset border width on each layouting
