Some BUGS/TODOS:
    - keyboardfocus stays in window, if cursor is over it and herbstluftwm-focus goes away
    - set range for some integer-setting-values
    - don't always re-layout all if only one thing changes (e.g. border_color)
    - don't reset border width on each layouting
    - herbstclient: add timeout if server doesnot respond
    - max-layout for clients
    - herbstclient: errorstatus2string2stderr
    - herbstclient: -h
    - urgent-handling (jumpto urgent)
    - completion für keybind (recursive!)
    - completion für keyunbind
    - move cursor after focus change
    - completion for merge_tag
    - optional focus selection after frame_split
    - ignore windows with property: _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION
    - add function to put window into tag (and use it in manage, merge_tag, move)
