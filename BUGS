Some BUGS:
    - keyboardfocus stays in window, if cursor is over it and herbstluftwm-focus goes away
    - set range for some integer-setting-values
    - don't always re-layout all if only one thing changes (e.g. border_color)
    - don't reset border width on each layouting
    - herbstclient: add timeout if server doesnot respond
    - herbstclient: errorstatus2string2stderr
    - herbstclient: -h
    - add function to put window into tag (and use it in manage, merge_tag, move)
    - the default panel.sh spawns too many shells and doesnot clean them up
      properly at quit. you should do something like killall panel.sh when
      logging out (this is only a workaround!).
    - Ensure stacking order is right (TODO: frame_restack())
    - Also handle stacking order right when switching desktops to avoid
      flickering. the xmonad-mailinglist tells:

          When changing desktop, you can map all the windows on the new desktop
          with a higher z-value than any of the windows on the old desktop, then
          unmap all the windows on the old desktop.

    - separate layout.[hc] into modules: layout, monitor, tag
    - raise_on_click doesn't work if raise_on_click and numlock is enabled
    - raise_on_click doesn't work with gnome-settings-daemon
    - window_gap actually should be called frame_gap
    - window_focus is called twice when switching desktops (before mapping
      windows and after mapping them). TODO: only do it once.
    - also update window title if *only* the _NET_WM_NAME changes

Planned features:
    - dump/load floating values
    - jumpto urgent
    - (optional) move cursor after focus change
    - optional focus selection after frame_split
    - focus_follows_mouse based on frames/monitors
    - mouse bindings in tiling mode
    - better xcompmgr support
    - keybind with keycodes
    - chain keys/key chains/...
    - lastfocused{window,frame,tag} - commands
    - own X-Properties to indicate window state (fullscreen, pseudotile, float,...)
    - bind multiple commands to one keycombindation via keybind, keybindadd
    - or: chain commands like: cmdchain 4 cmd1 arg1a arg1b arg1c cmd2 arg2a arg2b
    - alias commands: alias shortcmd = cmd default arg, alias shortcmd --delete
    - double window border to give a good contrast to dark backgrounded and
      light backgrounded windows.
    - provide multiple mechanisms to split clients to child frames:
         * 100:0 (and vice versa)
         * 50:50
         * clients before focus to the first child, others to the second
    - automatic split command which splits along the longest side
    - catchall for frames (this frame will catch all new clients)
    - try to find a empty frame for new clients
    - (currently unknown) handling of WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
    - move clients in pseudotile mode
    - allow clients to change their own floating size or even position (and
      make it configurable per rules)
    - transparent frames
    - undo command which undos the last layout changes on a certain tag
    - load frame without changing it's properties to just change the
      child-frames. Something like: (split unchanged $child1 child2)
    - add a commant close_or_remove that closes the current window or removes
      the current frame if it is empty
    - a more verbose tag_status: list_tags with one line per tag
    - cycle through all "invisible" (or non-focused) frames
