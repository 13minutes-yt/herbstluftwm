herbstluftwm migration guide
----------------------------

This guide describes the list of incompatible changes between the different
herbstluftwm releases and how to migrate scripts and configuration.

0.4 to 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~
herbstclient now returns the exitstatus 9 (HERBST_NEED_MORE_ARGS) instead of 3
(HERBST_INVALID_ARGUMENT) if a command needs more arguments. If an error occurs,
it now outputs an error message to stderr.

The padding arguments have been removed from add_monitor and a monitor name has
been added instead. If you add a monitor with padding, instead of 'hc
add_monitor 1024x768+0+0 1 2 3 4' now use 'hc add_monitor 1024x768+0+0; hc pad N
1 2 3 4'.

As a result from adding monitor names, the output of list_monitors and stack
changes a bit for named monitors.

0.3 to 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~
The setting window_gap is now called frame_gap. Simply replace all occurrences
of window_gap by frame_gap in your old scripts (and autostart).

0.2 to 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~
The setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by rules. You
can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your autostart by 'rule
class~"$foo" manage=off'

// vim: tw=80
