herbstluftwm migration guide
----------------------------

This guide describes the list of incompatible changes between the different
herbstluftwm releases and how to migrate scripts and configuration.

0.3 to 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~
The setting window_gap is now called frame_gap. Simply replace all occurrences
of window_gap by frame_gap in your old scripts (and autostart).

0.2 to 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~
The setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by rules. You
can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your autostart by 'rule
class~"$foo" manage=off'

// vim: tw=80
