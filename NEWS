herbstluftwm NEWS -- History of user-visible changes
----------------------------------------------------

Next release: 0.4
-----------------

Changes:

    * new command: close_or_remove
    * new flags '-' and '%' for tag_status for multi monitor handling
    * toggle default panel on hook togglehidepanel
    * new setting: window_border_urgent_color

Release 0.3 on 2012-04-12
-------------------------

Changes:

    * new hook: window_title_changed
    * hook focus_changed now also reports the window title
    * the setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by
      rules. You can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your
      autostart by 'rule class~"$foo" manage=off'
    * remember the value when toggling a setting and restore it on next toggle
    * new command: cycle_value
    * new commands: use_index, move_index
    * recursive command completion for keybind
    * new rule condition: title
    * in the default autostart:

        - new green and gray color theme
        - use/move was replaced by use_index/move_index
    * proper signal handling: map all windows on SIGINT,SIGQUIT,SIGTERM
    * respect the initial fullscreen state of new clients on startup (as it is
      set in the _NET_WM_STATE property)
    * monitor locking mechanism, i.e. a new setting: monitors_locked with its
      accessors lock and unlock and the command line argument -l and --locked

        - condition: windowtype
        - condition: windowrole
        - operator: = (equals)
        - operator: ~ (regex-matching)

        - flag: not (negation of conditions)
        - consequence: tag
        - consequence: focus
        - consequence: index (where to insert a new client in layout tree)
        - consequence: pseudotile
        - consequence: fullscreen
        - consequence: manage (whether window will be managed)

    * basic ewmh features:

            _NET_CLIENT_LIST
            _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP
            _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES
            _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS
            _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK
            _NET_WM_DESKTOP
            _NET_WM_STATE: fullscreen

        - the following client messages are handled:
            _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
            _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP
            _NET_WM_STATE: fullscreen


Release 0.1 on 2011-10-02
-------------------------

Initial release. The tiling algorithm and many things are working. But some
things like EWMH or rules aren't implemented yet (See BUGS file for a list of
planned features). Currently implemented features are:

    * basic tiling concept
    * floating mode (with border snapping)
    * calling herbstluftwm internal commands with herbstclient
    * change keybindings/mousebindings at runtime
    * change/get settings (e.g. colors) at runtime
    * add/remove monitors at runtime
    * wmexec into other window manager
    * dump/load tiling layouts to/from a string
    * bash/zsh tab completion for herbstclient
    * hook system: let herbstclient listen for internal events
    * provide an easy way to build an own panel (using herbstclient hooks/commands)
      (there is also an example panel.sh)
    * give information about urgent state of clients
