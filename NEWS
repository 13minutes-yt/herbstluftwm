Next release: 0.3
-----------------

Changes:

    * new hook: window_title_changed
    * hook focus_changed now also reports the window title
    * the setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by
      rules. You can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your
      autostart by 'rule class~"$foo" manage=off'
    * new green and gray color theme
    * remember the value when toggling a setting and restore it on next toggle

    * change keybindings/mousebindings at runtime
    * change/get settings (e.g. colors) at runtime
    * add/remove monitors at runtime
    * wmexec into other window manager
    * dump/load tiling layouts to/from a string
    * bash/zsh tab completion for herbstclient
    * hook system: let herbstclient listen for internal events
    * provide an easy way to build an own panel (using herbstclient hooks/commands)
      (there is also an example panel.sh)
    * give information about urgent state of clients
