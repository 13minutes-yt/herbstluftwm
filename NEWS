herbstluftwm NEWS -- History of user-visible changes
----------------------------------------------------

Next Release: 0.5
-----------------

Changes:

    * new setting: wmname
    * hook togglehidepanel: the default panel.sh also accepts the parameters
      "current" or a certain monitor index
    * align captions of the tree output (commands: layout, stack) better by
      inserting a space in front of every caption

Release: 0.4.1 on 2012-08-30
----------------------------

This fixes some build system issues:

    * Separate CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS
    * Add patch level to the version number
    * Only use __MACH__ if really needed
    * Honor CPPFLAGS

Release: 0.4 on 2012-08-18
--------------------------

Changes that requres user interaction on upgrade:

    * the setting window_gap is now called frame_gap

Other changes:

    * new setting window_gap which controlls the gap between windows within one
      frame
    * new setting: frame_padding
    * new command: close_or_remove
    * new flags '-' and '%' for tag_status for multi monitor handling
    * toggle default panel on hook togglehidepanel
    * new setting: window_border_urgent_color
    * new command: set_monitors
    * new command: disjoin_rects
    * new command: jumpto
    * use clock_get_time on systems with a mach kernel (typically Mac OS X).
      This lets herbstluftwm run on Mac systems again.
    * fix many memory leaks.
    * new command line flag --skip-visible for use_index and move_index
    * new command: detect_monitors, to detect Xinerama monitors automatically
    * new ewmh feature: react to _NET_WM_DESKTOP client messages
    * new command: rotate
    * new setting: auto_detect_monitors
    * only one Makefile for herbstluftwm and herbstclient. The herbstclient
      binary now is put in the main directory.
    * new settings: smart_frame_surroundings and smart_window_surroundings
    * new settings: window_border_inner_color and window_border_inner_width
    * new settings: frame_border_inner_color and frame_border_inner_width
    * new option --skip-invisible for cycle_all
    * cycle_layout now offers to cycle through a custom list of layouts
    * add completion for +1 and -1 to many commands: cycle, cycle_all,
      cycle_monitor, cycle_layout, split and use_index
    * new settings: smart_frame_surroundings and smart_window_borders
    * start system wide autostart file if there is no working user defined one
    * clients are restored (i.e. managed) from _NET_CLIENT_LIST even if they
      are not visible
    * do proper window and monitor stacking, this also introduces:

      - new command: raise_monitor
      - new setting: raise_on_focus_temporarily
      - new command: stack
    * new command: focus_nth
    * new command: bring
    * respect the WM_TAKE_FOCUS atom, this fixes keyboard focus issues with
      many (mostly Java/swing based) applications
    * new rule consequences: switchtag, ewmhrequests

Release 0.3 on 2012-04-12
-------------------------

Changes:

    * new hook: window_title_changed
    * hook focus_changed now also reports the window title
    * the setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by
      rules. You can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your
      autostart by 'rule class~"$foo" manage=off'
    * remember the value when toggling a setting and restore it on next toggle
    * new command: cycle_value
    * new commands: use_index, move_index
    * recursive command completion for keybind
    * new rule condition: title
    * in the default autostart:

        - new green and gray color theme
        - use/move was replaced by use_index/move_index
    * proper signal handling: map all windows on SIGINT,SIGQUIT,SIGTERM
    * respect the initial fullscreen state of new clients on startup (as it is
      set in the _NET_WM_STATE property)
    * monitor locking mechanism, i.e. a new setting: monitors_locked with its
      accessors lock and unlock and the command line argument -l and --locked

Release 0.2 on 2012-01-25
-------------------------

Small bugfixes and major features:

    * new command: monitor_rect
    * let panel.sh fork less often
    * set clients to fullscreen
    * new client layouting algorithm: grid layout
    * new command argument: keyunbind --all
    * new command: pseudotile (tile client but keep its floating size)
    * new command: list_keybinds
    * new hook: focus_changed
    * client rules with:

        - conditon: class
        - conditon: instance
        - conditon: pid
        - conditon: maxage
        - condition: windowtype
        - condition: windowrole
        - operator: = (equals)
        - operator: ~ (regex-matching)
        - flag: once
        - flag: not (negation of conditions)
        - consequence: tag
        - consequence: focus
        - consequence: index (where to insert a new client in layout tree)
        - consequence: pseudotile
        - consequence: fullscreen
        - consequence: manage (whether window will be managed)

    * basic ewmh features:

        - the following properties will be set:
            _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
            _NET_CLIENT_LIST
            _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP
            _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES
            _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS
            _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK
            _NET_WM_DESKTOP
            _NET_WM_STATE: fullscreen

        - the following client messages are handled:
            _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
            _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP
            _NET_WM_STATE: fullscreen


Release 0.1 on 2011-10-02
-------------------------

Initial release. The tiling algorithm and many things are working. But some
things like EWMH or rules aren't implemented yet (See BUGS file for a list of
planned features). Currently implemented features are:

    * basic tiling concept
    * floating mode (with border snapping)
    * calling herbstluftwm internal commands with herbstclient
    * change keybindings/mousebindings at runtime
    * change/get settings (e.g. colors) at runtime
    * add/remove monitors at runtime
    * wmexec into other window manager
    * dump/load tiling layouts to/from a string
    * bash/zsh tab completion for herbstclient
    * hook system: let herbstclient listen for internal events
    * provide an easy way to build an own panel (using herbstclient hooks/commands)
      (there is also an example panel.sh)
    * give information about urgent state of clients
